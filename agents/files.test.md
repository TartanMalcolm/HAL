The types of test are:

1. coherence - at every state of the system, have any of the business rules been broken
2. responses - with a given prompt, the response should be within a set
   tolerance of the expected qualities of the response

? what about testing model shape ?
? testing changes to the file system separately to responses
? testing tool calls

Why does it feel like we still need specific tests that we write ? Is this the
synthesizer ?
